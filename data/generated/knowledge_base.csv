MANUAL,AUTOCLAVE_2000,Vacuum System,VAC-001,Vacuum Seal Replacement Procedure,"Vacuum Seal B Replacement Procedure for Autoclave 2000 Series:
            
1. Safety: Ensure autoclave is at ambient temperature and pressure. Lock out power.
2. Access: Remove the 8 hex bolts on the door seal housing using 13mm socket.
3. Inspection: Check seal groove for debris or damage. Clean with isopropyl alcohol.
4. Installation: Install new Vacuum Seal B (Part #VS-2847) starting at 12 o'clock position.
5. Verification: Apply vacuum to -0.95 bar and hold for 15 minutes. Accept if leak rate < 0.01 mbar/min.
6. Documentation: Record seal replacement in CMMS with batch traceability.

Common failure modes: Seal degradation from thermal cycling, contamination from resin outgassing.
Expected life: 500-800 cure cycles depending on operating conditions.",AUTOCLAVE_2000_MAINTENANCE_MANUAL.pdf,0
MANUAL,CNC_MILL_5000,Spindle Assembly,VIB-001,Spindle Vibration Calibration,"Spindle Vibration Sensor Calibration for CNC Mill 5000:
            
1. Prerequisites: Machine at operating temperature (min 30 min warmup). No tooling installed.
2. Access calibration mode: Control Panel > Service > Calibration > Spindle
3. Run baseline: Execute spindle ramp 0-12000 RPM over 60 seconds
4. Capture readings: Record vibration at 3000, 6000, 9000, 12000 RPM
5. Thresholds: 
   - Normal: < 0.3 G peak
   - Warning: 0.3-0.5 G peak
   - Critical: > 0.5 G peak
6. If above threshold, check spindle bearing preload and balance.

Typical causes of elevated vibration: Bearing wear, coolant contamination, imbalanced toolholder.",CNC_MILL_5000_CALIBRATION_GUIDE.pdf,1
CMMS_LOG,AUTOCLAVE_2000,Vacuum System,VAC-001,WO-20230915-047 Vacuum Leak Resolution,"Work Order: WO-20230915-047
Date: September 15, 2023
Asset: AUTOCLAVE_02
Technician: Mike Rodriguez

Problem: Vacuum decay rate exceeded 0.05 mbar/min during cure cycle. Batch BATCH-20230915-03 aborted.

Investigation: 
- Visual inspection found scoring on door seal groove
- Seal B showed hardening and cracking (1247 cycles since last replacement)
- No contamination detected in vacuum lines

Resolution:
- Replaced Vacuum Seal B with Part #VS-2847 (Lot: 2023-Q3-042)
- Cleaned and polished seal groove
- Verified vacuum hold: 0.008 mbar/min (within spec)

Root Cause: Extended seal life beyond recommended interval due to supply chain delay.

Recommendation: Increase safety stock of vacuum seals to prevent future delays.

Downtime: 2 hours 15 minutes

CMMS_LOG,LAYUP_ROOM,HVAC,HUM-001,WO-20231022-089 Humidity Excursion Investigation,"Work Order: WO-20231022-089
Date: October 22, 2023
Asset: LAYUP_ROOM
Technician: Sarah Chen

Problem: Multiple batches from October 21-22 showing elevated delamination scores. 
QC flagged 6 batches for rework.

Investigation:
- Reviewed sensor data: Humidity peaked at 72% during 8am-12pm shift
- HVAC system running at capacity but unable to maintain setpoint
- Weather data showed unusual humidity spike (external 85% RH)
- Correlated affected batches to high-humidity layup window

Resolution:
- Adjusted HVAC dehumidification setpoint from 55% to 50%
- Added supplemental portable dehumidifier to layup area
- Implemented humidity trending alert at 60% threshold

Root Cause: HVAC sizing inadequate for extreme weather events. 
Correlation confirmed between layup humidity >65% and cure defects.

Cost Impact: 6 batches reworked @ $12,000 each = $72,000
Recommended CapEx: HVAC capacity upgrade ($150,000)
Payback: <3 months at current defect rate",CMMS_EXPORT_2023Q4.json,3
SOP,AUTOCLAVE_2000,Cure Cycle,,Golden Batch Cure Profile for Avalanche X1,"Standard Operating Procedure: Avalanche X1 Cure Cycle
Document: SOP-CURE-001 Rev 3.2

Golden Batch Parameters:
- Ramp Rate: 2°C/min to 180°C
- Dwell: 120 minutes at 180°C ± 3°C
- Pressure: 100 psi ± 5 psi
- Vacuum: -0.95 bar minimum
- Cool Down: 3°C/min to 60°C before door open

Critical Control Points:
1. Pre-cure vacuum test: Must hold -0.95 bar for 5 min with <0.02 mbar/min leak rate
2. Temperature uniformity: All zones within ±3°C during dwell
3. Exotherm monitoring: If part temp exceeds bag temp by >10°C, extend dwell

Quality Gates:
- Delamination Score threshold: <25 (pass), 25-50 (review), >50 (reject)
- Void Content: <2% by volume
- Glass Transition Temp: >195°C (DMA verification)

Batch Release Criteria: All parameters within spec AND traceability complete.",SOP_CURE_AVALANCHE_X1.pdf,4
